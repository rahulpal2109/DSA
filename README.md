# DSA
Data Structure and Algorithms

All DSA stuff goes in here, structured over multiple modules/projects.

Idea is to complete Challenge 1, Challenge 2. But we can do in parallel too.


## Details:
### Challenge 1

Java2Blog 100 questions -> https://java2blog.com/java-coding-interview-questions/

### Challenge 2: 
Striver SDE sheet       -> https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/

### Challenge 3: 
Leetcode Problems       -> https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/
